FuzzyTabs is a minimal browser extension that lets you quickly find and switch between your open tabs using fuzzy
search.
It runs instantly, stays out of your way, and keeps resource usage low.

## Motivation

Firefox has a built-in search for tabs, but it's not as fast and convenient as FuzzyTabs:
1) You have to open the search bar
2) type the `%` + space
3) then type a search query
4) select the right tab

ðŸ‘» **and there is no Fuzzy Search!**

ðŸš€ FuzzyTabs lets you jump to the right tab much faster.

## Features

- Fuzzy search: Type a few characters and jump to the right tab with smart, forgiving matching.
- Fast: Snappy overlay with near-instant filtering across all your open tabs.
- Lightweight: Small footprint, no tracking, minimal permissions.
- Open source: Built in the open â€” contributions and ideas are welcome.

## Usage

- Open: Click the FuzzyTabs toolbar button
- Navigate: Arrow Up/Down or `Ctrl+N` / `Ctrl+P`
- Activate the selected tab: Enter
- Close the selected tab: `Ctrl+W` (macOS) / `Alt+W` (Linux/Windows)
  Note that it's not possible to override the default close tab shortcut, so we use non-standard shortcuts.
